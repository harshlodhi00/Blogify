---------------Git Hub Notes-------------------

First git init
then make a repososity on github
copy link of like this : " git remote add origin https://github.com/harshlodhi00/Blogify.git"
that is git remote add origin command 

then git add . 
then git commit -m "message"
then git push -u origin master

then check git status




middlewares

If we use app.use("Middleware") in index.js file and then it will use globally and run om every get and post route .
If we want to use middleware to certain route only then we have define within the route that is route.get("/", middleware, (req,res) => {}) in this way we can use this middleware to only that route




Error Handling 

Use try and catch 

and in catch throw new Error("Error")

then to catch that error 


res.locals.error

res.render("signup", { error: "An error occurred during signup!" }


{ user: req.user }
